# CS-4650-Full-Stack-MEAN

We used Express as a framework by installing via command. Express is tool that is flexible and it calls the code via APIs with Node.js. We used HTML to manually create the UI via code. We used the NoSQL database due to its flexibility with our SPA application. This helped us store our data in a key value / document pair instead of Relational. 

JSON is different from JavaScript since it cannot contain functions. This is useful when transferring data elements, which is why JSON was used for APIs. 

For testing we used MongoDB compass to check the connection of the APIs and ensure the calls and messages were successful.  We had to check for both successful and unsuccessful calls. 

This course has helped me with sharpening my skills in both frond end and back end. Not many schools teach full stack as a single course, so I am grateful for learning the full stack process. I was not as good with back end work coming into this course and I gained a lot of confidence with being able to install various tools and execute them successfully.
